# Roomba-Simulation
Hi my name is Jason Alvarez! This is a my simlution of a "Roomba" cleaning a "room" using Java and JavaFX. THis isnt by any means how a Roomba actually works I just thought the idea was fairly similar. 

If you dont have JavaFX set up on your IDE you will have to set it up so this program will work. The files in .VScode are files that are needed to run JavaFX applications. If you are using any other IDE those files may not be necessary.
