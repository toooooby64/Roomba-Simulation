# Roomba-Simulation
Hi my name is Jason Alvarez! This is a my simlution of a "Roomba" cleaning a "room" using Java and JavaFX. This isnt by any means how a Roomba actually works I just thought the idea was fairly similar. 

I currrently dont know how to have users install the JavaFX dependencies, but if you want to run this application on your device you can use the following videos to help you install and set up JavaFX. If you are using the Eclipse IDE you can use this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk28ytggz7E. If you are using VS code you can use this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67COH9F718. Finally if you are using IntelliJ IDE you can use this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ope4icw6bVk.
